# Privacy Ignore Patterns
# Add regex patterns here to exempt known safe matches from privacy validation
# Each line is a regex pattern that will be matched against found violations
#
# Examples:
# ^127\.0\.0\.1$          # Allow localhost IP
# ^192\.168\.1\.1$        # Allow specific private IP
# /Users/example          # Allow specific user path
# example\.com            # Allow domain patterns
#
# Note: Patterns are matched using re.search(), so partial matches are allowed

# Common safe IP addresses (localhost and example IPs)
127\.0\.0\.1
0\.0\.0\.0
192\.168\.1\.0
192\.168\.\d+\.\d+
